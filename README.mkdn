## Developing Scala plugin

In order to take part in Scala plugin development, you need to:

1. Install the following software:
    - SBT 0.13.5 or higher
    - IntelliJ IDEA 14 or higher with compatible version of Scala plugin and ant support enabled

2. Fork this repository and clone it to your computer

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala.git
  ```

3. Open IntelliJ IDEA, select `File -> New -> Project from existing sources`, point to
the directory where Scala plugin repository is and then import it as SBT project.

4. When importing is finished, go to Scala plugin repo directory and run

  ```
  $ git checkout .idea
  ```

  in order to get artifacts and run configurations for IDEA project.

5. To build Scala plugin you need to give at least 2GB of the heap size to the compiler process.
   - if you use Scala Compile Server (default):
   ```Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Scala Compile Server > JVM maximum heap size```

   - if Scala Compile Server is disabled:
   ```Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Build process heap size```
