<p>This inspection identifies method calls where an argument that could potentially be <code>null</code>
    is passed to a parameter that that is not annotated with <code>@Nullable</code>,
    helping to detect potential <code>NullPointerExceptions</code> before they occur at runtime.</p>
<p>This inspection is only shown for targeted methods that are in the project's source code.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
<code>
def test(@Nullable greeting: String): Unit = {
  sayHello(greeting)
}

def sayHello(greeting: String): Unit = {
  println(greeting.toLowerCase)
}
</code>
