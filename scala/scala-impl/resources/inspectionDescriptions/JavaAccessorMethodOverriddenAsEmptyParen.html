<body>Methods that follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBean">JavaBean</a> naming contract for accessors are
expected
to have no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>.

The recommended convention is to use a parameterless method whenever there are
no parameters and the method have no side effect.

This convention supports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access
    principle</a>, which says that client code
should not be affected by a decision to implement an attribute as a field or method.

The problem is that Java does not implement the uniform access principle.

To bridge that gap, Scala allows you to override an empty-paren method with
a parameterless method.

In accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution
    principle</a>, as overridden method has no side effects,
the overriding method must also be declared as a method without side effects.
