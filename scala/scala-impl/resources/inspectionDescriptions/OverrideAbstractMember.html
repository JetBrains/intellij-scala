Reports functions that override abstract members but do not have an override modifier.
<p>Scala does not require the developer to use <code>override</code> on methods that implement abstract members.
Nonetheless, it is a good idea to mark such methods with <code>override</code> to be notified
    by the compiler when the override relationship gets broken (by a subsequent refactoring, for example).</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
trait Base {
  def fun(): Int
}

class Impl extends Base {
  def fun(): Int = 42
}
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
trait Base {
  def fun(): Int
}

class Impl extends Base {
  override def fun(): Int = 42
}
</code></pre>
