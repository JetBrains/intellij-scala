/**
 * JDK's CompletableFuture does not handle cancellation well.
 * When a future overrides a `cancel` method, it is lost
 * when doing transformations like `thenApply` or `thenCompose`.
 *
 * In Java 9, the new CompletableFuture's method was introduced: `newIncompleteFuture`.
 * When using it, the cancel method of the original future will be called event when the
 * `cancel` is done on a transformed one.
 *
 * When we know about CompletableFutures that override `cancel` methods, we should convert them
 * to CancellableFuture before calling methods like `thenCompose`
 *
 * The `newIncompleteFuture` is not annotated with @Override, so the code can be compiled with both JVM8 and JVM9
 * (and newer), but the actuall cancellation effect takes place only with 9 or newer.
