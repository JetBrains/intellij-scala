<body>Methods that follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBean">JavaBean</a> naming contract for accessors are
expected to have no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>. The
recommended convention is to use a parameterless method whenever there are no parameters and the method have no side
effect. This convention supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access
principle</a>, which says that client code should not be affected by a decision to implement an attribute as a field
or method.
