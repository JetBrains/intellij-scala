<body>The recommended convention is to use a parameterless method whenever there are
no parameters and the method have no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side
    effects</a>.

This convention supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access
    principle</a>, which says that client code
should not be affected by a decision to implement an attribute as a field or method.

In accordance with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution
    principle</a>, as overriden method is parameterless,
the overriding method must also be declared as a method without side effects.
