<body>The convention is that method includes parentheses if it has <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>. While it's possible to
leave out empty parentheses in method calls (to adapt the <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access principle</a> to Java), it's
recommended to still write the empty parentheses when the invoked method represents more than a property of its receiver
object.
