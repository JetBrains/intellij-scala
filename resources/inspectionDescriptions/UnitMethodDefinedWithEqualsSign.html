This inspection became deprecated.
<br/>
It is not recommended to use procedure-like syntax for methods with <code>Unit</code> return type. It is inconsistent,
may lead to errors and will be deprecated in future versions of Scala.

    Methods with a result type of Unit are only executed for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>.
    <br><br>
    A better way to express such methods is to leave off the equals sign, and enclose
    the body of the method in curly braces.
    <br><br>
    In this form, the method looks like a procedure, a method that is executed only
    for its side effects:
    <br><br>
    // excessive clutter, looks like a function<br>
    def close() = { println("closed") } // may accidentally change its result type<br>
    // after changes in body<br>
    def close() = { file.delete() } // result type is Boolean<br>
    // concise form, side-effect is clearly stated<br>
    // result type is always Unit<br>
    def close() { file.delete() } <br><br/>
